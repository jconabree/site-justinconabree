# Justin Conabree Personal Website
Welcome to the repository for my personal website!

This is the code that runs [justinconabree.com](https://justinconabree.com).

## The Stack
The tech stack and some key integrations:
- Next.js (v15.2)
- Typescript (v5)
- GraphQL (Apollo)
- Tailwind CSS (v3)
- Contentful
- Sendgrid
- Recaptcha
- Google Analytics
- GSAP
- Slick

## Usage
This project was made to showcase some of the projects I've worked on over the years. The project itself is part of that showcase. I had fun making it and working with some new and interesting technologies.

### For developers stumbling across this
Feel more than free to use this repo as a starting point for your own (non-commercial) project

### For evaluators
Overall the project is decent, but there are many, many things I would change about the code and site if I had unlimited time and energy.

From styling that's just _off_, to the `app-pages` folder that contains a mix of sections but also components. If you're evaluating this code or the website, know that I have a long list of optimizations that'll I'll probably never get around to doing ☺️
